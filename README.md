# Cpu-Pipeline-Simulator
A simple CPU Pipeline Simulator built in C/C++ to demonstrate the functioning of instruction-level pipelining in computer architecture. This project simulates stages like Fetch, Decode, Execute, Memory, and Write Back, helping students and enthusiasts visualize how modern processors handle instructions concurrently.

Instruction parsing and execution

Classic 5-stage pipeline simulation:

Fetch (IF)

Decode (ID)

Execute (EX)

Memory (MEM)

Write Back (WB)

Data and control hazard detection

Basic forwarding and stalling mechanism

Debug output to trace instruction flow
